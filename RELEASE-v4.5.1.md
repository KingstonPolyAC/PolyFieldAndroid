### 2. Heatmap Visualization Improvements
- **✅ Landscape Mode Support**: Optimized 70/30 layout (heatmap/controls) for better viewing
- **✅ Improved Scaling**: Automatically scales to show furthest throw with proper centering
- **✅ Distance Arcs**: Visual 10m distance circles for better spatial reference
- **✅ EDM Position Display**: Shows EDM location with blue crosshair marker
- **✅ Sector Lines**: Full-length sector lines showing legal throwing area (34.92° UKA-compliant)
- **✅ Enhanced Statistics**: Consistency score and comprehensive throw analysis

### 3. Background Sync System
- **✅ Real-time Sync**: Immediate result upload after each measurement
- **✅ Periodic Backup**: Automatic sync every 15 minutes ensures no data loss
- **✅ Network Resilient**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed uploads

- **✅ Cache Management**: Failed results cached and automatically retried

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Competition Flow
- Fixed athlete cut not applying for rounds 4-6
- Fixed position display showing "1" for all athletes instead of dynamic ranking
- Fixed reordering not working when checkbox enabled
- Fixed athlete rotation filtering for final rounds
- Fixed `applyAthleteReorder()` function that was just a TODO stub

### Heatmap Display
- Fixed tiny heatmap display in landscape mode
- Fixed missing distance arcs and EDM position
- Fixed scaling to properly show all throws
- Fixed centering to use 70% vertical position for better visibility

## ✅ Technical Validation

### EDM Calculation Verification
- ✅ Implementation validated against `EDMCalculation.pdf` specification
- ✅ All measurement formulas verified: `hd = sd * cos(90° - va)`
- ✅ Angle parsing (DDDMMSS → decimal degrees) matches spec
- ✅ Polar to Cartesian transformation correct
- ✅ UKA competition standards compliance confirmed
- ✅ Distance calculation methodology verified

### Code Quality
- Enhanced error handling in sync operations
- Improved coordinate transformation for heatmap display
- Better landscape/portrait layout adaptation
- Optimized background worker scheduling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## 🎯 Usage Notes

### For Competition Officials
1. Athlete cut is automatically applied when transitioning from round 3 to round 4
2. Position badges update in real-time as measurements are recorded
3. Heatmaps show individual athlete patterns and overall competition distribution
4. Results automatically sync to server - no manual intervention needed

### For Developers
- Background sync uses Android WorkManager for reliability
